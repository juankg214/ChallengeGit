Sing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought
countless ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did it send hurrying down
to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures, for so were
the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on which the son of Atreus, king of
men, and great Achilles, first fell out with one another.

And which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was the son of
Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king and sent a pestilence upon the
host to plague the people, because the son of Atreus had dishonoured Chryses
his priest. Now Chryses had come to the ships of the Achaeans to free his
daughter, and had brought with him a great ransom: moreover he bore in his
hand the sceptre of Apollo wreathed with a suppliant's wreath, and he
besought the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus, who were their
chiefs.

"Sons of Atreus," he cried, "and all other Achaeans, may the gods who
dwell in Olympus grant you to sack the city of Priam, and to reach your homes
in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a ransom for her, in reverence to
Apollo, son of Jove."

On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting the
priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon, who
spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. "Old man," said he, "let me
not find you tarrying about our ships, nor yet coming hereafter. Your sceptre of
the god and your wreath shall profit you nothing. I will not free her. She shall
grow old in my house at Argos far from her own home, busying herself with
her loom and visiting my couch; so go, and do not provoke me or it shall be
the worse for you."

The old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but went by the
shore of the sounding sea and prayed apart to King Apollo whom lovely Leto
had borne. "Hear me," he cried, "O god of the silver bow, that protectest
Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos with thy might, hear me oh thou of
Sminthe. If I have ever decked your temple with garlands, or burned your
thigh-bones in fat of bulls or goats, grant my prayer, and let your arrows
avenge these my tears upon the Danaans."

Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came down furious from
the summits of Olympus, with his bow and his quiver upon his shoulder, and
the arrows rattled on his back with the rage that trembled within him. He sat
himself down away from the ships with a face as dark as night, and his silver
bow rang death as he shot his arrow in the midst of them. First he smote their
mules and their hounds, but presently he aimed his shafts at the people
themselves, and all day long the pyres of the dead were burning.

For nine whole days he shot his arrows among the people, but upon the
tenth day Achilles called them in assembly—moved thereto by Juno, who saw
the Achaeans in their death-throes and had compassion upon them. Then,
when they were got together, he rose and spoke among them.

"Son of Atreus," said he, "I deem that we should now turn roving home if
we would escape destruction, for we are being cut down by war and pestilence
at once. Let us ask some priest or prophet, or some reader of dreams (for
dreams, too, are of Jove) who can tell us why Phoebus Apollo is so angry, and
say whether it is for some vow that we have broken, or hecatomb that we have
not offered, and whether he will accept the savour of lambs and goats without
blemish, so as to take away the plague from us."

With these words he sat down, and Calchas son of Thestor, wisest of
augurs, who knew things past present and to come, rose to speak. He it was
who had guided the Achaeans with their fleet to Ilius, through the
prophesyings with which Phoebus Apollo had inspired him. With all sincerity
and goodwill he addressed them thus:—

And Achilles answered, "Fear not, but speak as it is borne in upon you
from heaven, for by Apollo, Calchas, to whom you pray, and whose oracles
you reveal to us, not a Danaan at our ships shall lay his hand upon you, while I
yet live to look upon the face of the earth—no, not though you name
Agamemnon himself, who is by far the foremost of the Achaeans."

Thereon the seer spoke boldly. "The god," he said, "is angry neither about
vow nor hecatomb, but for his priest's sake, whom Agamemnon has
dishonoured, in that he would not free his daughter nor take a ransom for her;
therefore has he sent these evils upon us, and will yet send others. He will not
deliver the Danaans from this pestilence till Agamemnon has restored the girl
without fee or ransom to her father, and has sent a holy hecatomb to Chryse.
Thus we may perhaps appease him."

With these words he sat down, and Agamemnon rose in anger. His heart
was black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he scowled on Calchas and
said, "Seer of evil, you never yet prophesied smooth things concerning me, but
have ever loved to foretell that which was evil. You have brought me neither
comfort nor performance; and now you come seeing among Danaans, and
saying that Apollo has plagued us because I would not take a ransom for this
girl, the daughter of Chryses. I have set my heart on keeping her in my own
house, for I love her better even than my own wife Clytemnestra, whose peer
she is alike in form and feature, in understanding and accomplishments. Still I
will give her up if I must, for I would have the people live, not die; but you
must find me a prize instead, or I alone among the Argives shall be without
one. This is not well; for you behold, all of you, that my prize is to go
elsewhither."

And Achilles answered, "Most noble son of Atreus, covetous beyond all
mankind, how shall the Achaeans find you another prize? We have no
common store from which to take one. Those we took from the cities have
been awarded; we cannot disallow the awards that have been made already.
Give this girl, therefore, to the god, and if ever Jove grants us to sack the city
of Troy we will requite you three and fourfold."


Then Agamemnon said, "Achilles, valiant though you be, you shall not
thus outwit me. You shall not overreach and you shall not persuade me. Are
you to keep your own prize, while I sit tamely under my loss and give up the
girl at your bidding? Let the Achaeans find me a prize in fair exchange to my
liking, or I will come and take your own, or that of Ajax or of Ulysses; and he
to whomsoever I may come shall rue my coming. But of this we will take
thought hereafter; for the present, let us draw a ship into the sea, and find a
crew for her expressly; let us put a hecatomb on board, and let us send
Chryseis also; further, let some chief man among us be in command, either
Ajax, or Idomeneus, or yourself, son of Peleus, mighty warrior that you are,
that we may offer sacrifice and appease the anger of the god."
Achilles scowled at him and answered, "You are steeped in insolence and
lust of gain. With what heart can any of the Achaeans do your bidding, either
on foray or in open fighting? I came not warring here for any ill the Trojans
had done me. I have no quarrel with them. They have not raided my cattle nor
my horses, nor cut down my harvests on the rich plains of Phthia; for between
me and them there is a great space, both mountain and sounding sea. We have
followed you, Sir Insolence! for your pleasure, not ours—to gain satisfaction
from the Trojans for your shameless self and for Menelaus. You forget this,
and threaten to rob me of the prize for which I have toiled, and which the sons
of the Achaeans have given me. Never when the Achaeans sack any rich city
of the Trojans do I receive so good a prize as you do, though it is my hands
that do the better part of the fighting. When the sharing comes, your share is
far the largest, and I, forsooth, must go back to my ships, take what I can get
and be thankful, when my labour of fighting is done. Now, therefore, I shall go
back to Phthia; it will be much better for me to return home with my ships, for
I will not stay here dishonoured to gather gold and substance for you."
